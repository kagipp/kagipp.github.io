<p>Omelas is a utopia with the catch that there's a child locked away in a dungeon, and it's insinuated that this is necessary to preserve the goodness of the place. The child isn't even bad in nature, they're just locked away seemingly symbolically. In fact, everyone in this world seems very good and each one lives in harmony with each other, but there's seemingly a fear of badness or evil. I don't think there's anything wrong with this child; I think the people project their insecurity towards evil and sin onto the child so that they can feel pure and live apparently harmonious lives. I think this relates to psychologist Carl Jung's idea of "integrating one's shadow". It is apparently much easier to have a scapegoat for everything that goes wrong than to realize that evil can come from any one of us and we must all work mutually to teach each other and bring out the best in each other. Another idea I feel is connected to the story of Omelas is the yin-yang of Taoism, which is described as describing "opposite but interconnected, mutually perpectuating forces", which in this case may be good and evil, which might be further illustrated by the brightness of the procession contrasted with the darkness of the chamber of the wretched one. The principles of Taoism might show that this is necessary, but the scheme in which yin and yang coexist in Omelas is rather disturbing. What's actually distrubing, though, is how this innocent child (or who is no more innocent than any of the residents of Omelas) may actually become evil solely due to the treatment they are receiving. It's clear: the people of Omelas don't know how to manage the darker aspects of life, and they're adolescent minded for trying to go about it the way they are. The author says the pople of Omelas have no guilt, but I do not believe that is quite true. I think they are so very distracted and illusioned. I swear there's a constant anxiety, and it's uterlly exhausting, to maintain this illusion, so I think Omelas is funadematally unsustainable and I'm afraid about how it might fall. Omelas is a Black Mirror episode, which is to say that it reflects to us something dark about our own society. The people of Omelas can't stand the "wretched child", and they are shocked by it, but it's all a figment of their imgaination, because they can't stand to see such evil existing with themselves and dealing with it wisely and genuinely. The ones who do dare to, they walk away from Omelas; I guess it's just impossible to salvage an social environment like that.</p>
