  <h1>"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" Response</h1>
  <p>Omelas is a utopia with the catch that there's a child locked away in a dungeon, and it's insinuated that this is necessary to preserve the goodness of the place. The child isn't even bad in nature, they're just locked away seemingly symbolically. In fact, everyone in this world seems very good and each one lives in harmony with each other, but there's seemingly a fear of badness or evil. I don't think there's anything wrong with this child; I think the people project their insecurity towards evil and sin onto the child so that they can feel pure and live apparently harmonious lives. I think this relates to psychologist Carl Jung's idea of "integrating one's shadow". It is apparently much easier to have a scapegoat for everything that goes wrong than to realize that evil can come from any one of us and we must all work mutually to teach each other and bring out the best in each other. Another idea I feel is connected to the story of Omelas is the yin-yang of Taoism, which is described as describing "opposite but interconnected, mutually perpectuating forces", which in this case may be good and evil, which might be further illustrated by the brightness of the procession contrasted with the darkness of the chamber of the wretched one. The principles of Taoism might show that this is necessary, but the scheme in which yin and yang coexist in Omelas is rather disturbing. What's actually distrubing, though, is how this innocent child (or who is just as innocent than any of the residents of Omelas) may actually become evil solely due to the treatment they are receiving. It's clear: the people of Omelas don't know how to manage the darker aspects of life, and they're adolescent minded for trying to go about it the way they are. The author says the pople of Omelas have no guilt, but I don't believe that is quite true. I think they are so very distracted and illusioned. I swear there's a constant anxiety, and it's uterlly exhausting, to maintain this illusion, so I think Omelas is funadematally unsustainable and I'm afraid about how it might fall. Omelas is a Black Mirror episode, which is to say that it reflects to us something dark about our own society. The people of Omelas can't stand the "wretched child", and they are shocked by it, but it's all a figment of their imgaination, because they can't stand to see such evil existing with themselves and dealing with it wisely and genuinely. The ones who do dare to, they walk away from Omelas; I guess it's just impossible to salvage a social environment like that. Walking away from Omelas might be necessary to see new perspectives, but hopefully someone will come back and set the child free.</p>
  <p>Olivia Shutz posed the question,"Is there a way that we could realistically imagine a city where everyone is happy, without any suffering at all? Or is there always going to be a child suffering in the basement?" I find this thought provoking, and I'm wondering how one goes about chasing out evil, rooting it out of society, and how in the case of Omelas that seems to have turned out to be sequestering a child in the basement, just as I imagine they think they expertly compartmentalize and lock away the darkness within them. It seems like maintaining one's morality is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole. You condition yourself away from one bad habit, another pops up. I'm not a psychaitrist or pyschologist or sociologist, but I think a professional of that sort would have a credible opinion on how to prevent our society from looking like Omelas.</p>
  <p>Perhaps this roughly covres the bases of the ideas latent in the text. Though, there a couple more peculiarities I might comment on which shed more light into the situation of Omelas. There's a sentence in one of the last paragraphs of the text that I believe most clearly describes what's going on with the people of Omelas, beyond the fact that they sacrifice one child for the good of the many: "Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives." I would tentatively say that this shows that they subscribe to what philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche might call "slave morality." It's literally revealed here that the "source of the splendor" is the "acceptance of their helplessness." So one can say the people of Omelas are managing things in a bit of a religious way. Though, it's shown that you can also walk away, which can be likened to the other side of the morality dichotomy described by Nietzsche, "master morality." Briefly, those who subscibe to this morality might have it within themsleves to question their assumptions, create their own values, and in a sense strive for greatness rather that goodness. So, in sum, throughout the paper the author sorta keeps a stern, questioning tone, even referring to the reader, which I interpret as trying to tell the reader, basically, "Isn't this nice? But it isn't so nice, now is it? If this irks you, then, if you would like, you can, in fact, walk away." It seems to be beyond the scope of the piece to tell what exactly one should do besides walk away, which I suppose highlights the point that for some societal issues, just having the bravery to recognize that they're messed up is a feat in and of itself.</p>
