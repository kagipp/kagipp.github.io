<html><p>When it comes to the inclusivity of Black hair in video games, I feel it isn't exactly matter of social graces, rather, it seems like a good thing to do for our collective wellbeing (hear me out), but also perhaps a greatly lucrative thing to do. I really don't know much about race and sociology, but video games are like depictions of reality, like any media, and although it's for the most part ficticous, if one group or whatever isn't represented in media, we all may come to think they don't exist in reality. Perhaps that's more of a problem with confusing fact and fiction and leaning to heavily into escapism via video games, but as long as you're making a game that's indended to have some semblance to reality, you probably need to take care in what you're asserting in that game, explicitly or implicitly. So what was my thought about increasing the inclusivity of Black hair being lucrative? Simply, Black people do seem to be an underserved group in game dev, and I'm pretty sure the love for gaming transcends color, so, obviously, if you make games appeal to them, you'll attract a wider audience and make a lot more! Idk how much more, but it's enough to warrant a statistical investigation by major gaming companies. I'm probably missing a lot here, but at least I thought of it. Now I'm interested in the psychology in gaming... oh no, don't get me started about matchmaking algorithms!</p></html>
