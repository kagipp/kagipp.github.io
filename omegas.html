<p>Omelas is a utopia with the catch that there's a child locked away in a dungeon, and it's insinuated that this is necessary to preserve the goodness of the place. The child isn't even bad in nature, they're just locked away seemingly symbolically. In fact, everyone in this world seems very good and each one lives in harmony with each other, but there's seemingly a fear of badness or evil. I don't think there's anything wrong with this child; I think the people project their insecurity towards evil and sin onto the child so that they can feel pure and live apparently harmonious lives. I think this relates to psychologist Carl Jung's idea of "integrating one's shadow". It is apparently much easier to have a scapegoat for everything that goes wrong than to realize that evil can come from any one of us and we must all work mutually to teach each other and bring out the best in each other. Another idea I feel is connected to the story of Omelas is the yin-yang of Taoism, which is described as describing "opposite but interconnected, mutually perpectuating forces", which in this case may be good and evil, which might be further illustrated by the brightness of the procession contrasted with the darkness of the chamber of the wretched one. The principles of Taoism might show that this is necessary, but the scheme in which yin and yang coexist in Omelas is rather disturbing.</p>
